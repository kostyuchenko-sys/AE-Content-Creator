# Auto-deploy to AE after changes

- After editing files under `extension/cep/AEContentConstructor/**` or `packer/**`,
  run the deploy hook to sync changes to the local CEP folder:
  `.git/hooks/post-commit`.
- If no commit is needed, run the hook manually once after changes.
- Do not ask the user to “deploy” each time; keep the CEP folder in sync so
  they can test immediately in After Effects.
